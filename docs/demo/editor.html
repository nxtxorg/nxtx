\chapter(Unity)\label(fsharp-unity-development)
\section(Unity Extension)
As mentioned in \Ref(fsharp-unity-development), it was noticed that the participants had problems remembering to press compile in F# in the Unity editor. A solution to this could be automatically detecting if the F# files have been changed when focusing the Unity editor. If any changes are detected, the compiler could be invoked. A problem with this is that the hooks in the Unity \ac(API) only allows for reacting to changes to files in the \text:tt(Assets)-folder.
An alternative to detecting the file changes when the Unity editor is focused, is detecting the changes when the developers enters play-mode. This is also available to hook onto using the Unity \ac(API) and does not require the files to be placed in the \text:it(Assets)-folder.

\section(Benchmarking the Old .NET Framework Runtime)\label(sec:macrobench)
It would be interesting to see how the old Windows-only .NET Framework runtime performs compared to \text:tt(mono) and the new, cross-platform \text:tt(dotnet) runtime. A result that could be interesting to see is whether \text:tt(mono) is slower than the old, windows-only .NET runtime. If it is, then it seems counter-intuitive to base the game engine's scripting runtime on it, though this was most likely because of \text:tt(mono) being cross-platform and open-source, which the old .NET runtime was not. The new \text:tt(dotnet) runtime is both cross-platform and open-source, released under MIT license.

\section(Investigation on Start-Up Time)\label(sec:futurework-startup-time)
As explained in \ref(sec:macrobench), the macrobenchmark suffered under an extensive startup time. Why exactly this is so extensive would be an interesting find, beyond the guess that it is just \ac(JIT) warm-up. Especially so since the startup is slower in C# than it is in F#. One way to approach this would be to utilise Unity's Profiler tool, shown in \ref(fig:unity-profiler).

\chapter(More Unity)
\section(Language Support in Unity)

There have been several projects which aimed to add another language as the gameplay programming language to Unity, such as Arcadia and Casanova \cite(arcadia:github, casanova-autocompile).

These two projects have two different approaches to adding a new gameplay language.

Casanova is both declarative and procedural language, for writing gameplay code for Unity games \cite(designing-casanova). It is transpiled to C# for use with Unity, but one of the goals of the language is to have F# as a compile target \cite(casanova-autocompile, casanova-specs). Casanova is a much more high level language than most of the other gameplay languages used in free-to-play game engines. The language describes entities and the rules these entities follow.

Arcadia adds Clojure support to Unity via Clojure CLR: \dquote(a native implementation of Clojure on the Common Language Runtime)\footnote(https://clojure.org/about/clojureclr). Clojure is integrated as an interpreted language on top of Unity. This means the code can be modified while a game is running in the Unityeditor. It is mostly functional (and side-effect free), but has some specific functions that affect the state of the game.

One of the nice features of Clojure is \ac(STM), which is a way of handling concurrency. It is inspired from database transactions and a variant of transactional memory.
While there is no official page that states Clojure CLR has support for \ac(STM) there is some evidence, such as the \ac(STM) tests on their github page\footnote(https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr/blob/master/Clojure/Clojure.Source/clojure/samples/stm/). Arcadia and \ac(STM) were explored in a previous report, and the find was that \ac(STM) was not the go-to method of managing memory in Unity \cite(voresrapport).


\section(Game development tools)
In the academic, there has been made a few game engines.
One of those are JOT, JOT is a specialised modular multipurpose massively multiplayer online game engine \cite(amador2014jot).
JOT had a interesting and academic approach of making a paper that specified a design and a architecture for the game engine.
JOT was implemented in Java, due to Java's multiplatform abilities and the available third party applications and libraries.
The paper helps get a clearer picture of how a game engine can be designed and how a architecture can look.
